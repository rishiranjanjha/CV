# Rishi Ranjan Jha's Personal Website
Hey everyone My name is Rishi and This is My Personal website (Cv) which i made during my Web development course. 
In this we have used basic HTML commands like head , anchor , hr tag etc. to give basic structure to website. For layouts we have used tables and forms.
For connecting stuff we have used hyperlink tag (anchor).
This is designed just using HTML in future we will make full functional websites using full css and js.
